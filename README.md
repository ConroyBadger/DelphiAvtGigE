Delphi header translation for AVT GigE SDK

https://www.alliedvision.com/en/support/software-downloads.html

This isn't a complete header translation, I only did the parts I needed to
get things up and running. It should be a good starting point for most projects.

Special thanks to Antimodular Inc where I worked while writing this code.
They have generously allowed it into the public domain.

Also thanks to AVT for their input and help testing.
